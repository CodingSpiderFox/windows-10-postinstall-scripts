This is to avoid annoying popups which Avira might produce (I though didn't get any in the period of this 1 month while I was doing this and that).
*"avira_ipmgui_off.bat" might do some part of work for you, but I currently did not make it work, so here is the description on how to do the things manually.
To manipulate "C:\Program Files (x86)\Avira\Antivirus\ipmgui.exe" file permissions, in Avira 15.0.17.273 go to [Free] Antivirus or Manage Antivirus -> press any of "Open configuration" gear wheel icons to appear in another window Avira [Free] Antivirus -> General -> Security -> Protect files and registry entries from manipulation (disable it).
*Now, here is the place where "avira_ipmgui_off.bat" might do some actual work for you, but I didn't finish it.
Go at "ipmgui.exe" Properties -> Security -> Advanced, now disable inheritance (or otherwise any changes in settings will not be allowed (but only viewable)).
Do whatever you need with the file permissions of "ipmgui.exe" (disallow its execution).
Enable "Protect files and registry entries from manipulation".
Reboot.

Well, this actually doesn't work :)
Once you enable "Protect files and registry entries from manipulation", Avira returns the permission inheritance to "ipmgui.exe".
