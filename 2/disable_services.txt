I can't tell which exact services can be safely disabled, but these ones look not so necessary :
Diagnostic Policy Service,
Diagnostics Tracking Service (very few info on this one),
Shell Hardware Detection (the old version of CD autorun (or autoplay) was a nonsense; however, these days this service might do something necessary - I don't know),
SuperFetch (for a medium-memory systems this memory management tool is very helpful, but for a high-memory systems it might be a superfluous item),
Windows Font Cache Service (same as SuperFetch);
Delivery Optimization (if you don't need Windows' updates),
Downloaded Maps Manager (for Maps application),
Windows Search (well, if you don't use Windows Search),
dmwappushservice (Telemetry and Data Collection),

There also are alot of services for security purposes which I skipped :
Windows Defender Service,
Windows Firewall;
Security Center,

Basically, I don't disable any of them for the moment.
