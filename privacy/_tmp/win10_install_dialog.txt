Note that these registry files are for local-machine keys, - they though work after installation, but once you've triggered the settings manually, a current-user keys are created and the local-machine keys are not in use anymore.
Thus either don't touch the settings manually, or switch them manually back, or modify these scripts to affect current-user keys instead local-machine.
