Collection of scripts to use after Windows 10 installation.

*these script aren't necessarily harmless; it would be good to make a Restore Point first, and read the content of a script before running it.

The order of folders had the meaning of launch order for WinXP; now it likely is meaningless and the scripts can be run in any order.
Folder "5" has purely Win10-specific scripts.
Some scripts (if not all) require that they would be started with Administrator privileges.
